## 🌟 Professional Journey


Throughout my youth, I continuously built projects that expanded my programming skills. This hands-on experience naturally led me to pursue a degree in Software Engineering, which I'm currently completing. My education is strengthening my foundation in software architecture and engineering principles, complementing my self-taught abilities.

While I work across the full development stack, my true passion lies in backend development. I find particular satisfaction in designing server architectures, optimizing databases, and building efficient APIs. There's something compelling about creating the robust systems that power applications behind the scenes.

Currently, I am **working on a chatbot system** utilizing **WebSockets** and **AI** with **Java**, where I aim to integrate real-time communication and advanced machine learning capabilities. You can check out this project [here](https://github.com/matheushenw/javachatbot-IA).

My full-stack knowledge gives me a comprehensive understanding of how all parts of an application work together, which proves valuable when collaborating on complex projects. I'm constantly expanding my expertise in backend technologies while maintaining broad development capabilities.

My journey combines the creativity of a self-taught programmer with the disciplined approach of an engineering student—a blend that helps me develop innovative solutions to challenging problems.
